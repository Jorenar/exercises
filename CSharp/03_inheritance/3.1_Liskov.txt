It's arguably impossible to make Square inherit from Rectangle without breaking
Liskov's Substitution Principle since by definition square restricts rectangle
requirements, thus it's necessary to make changes to the underlying logic.
No matter what we do, we cannot make a square of width different from height.

In fact, while counterintuitive, it would be more plausible for Rectangle
to inherit after Square, since then Square could have a method for setting
side length, then we could just add explicit setters for width and height
in Rectangle.
